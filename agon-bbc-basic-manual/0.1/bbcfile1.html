<p>These notes start with some <a href="#basics">basic information on files</a>, and then go on to discuss <a href="#access">program file manipulation</a>, <a href="bbcfile2.html">simple serial files</a>, <a href="bbcfile3.html">random files</a> and, finally, <a href="bbcfile4.html">indexed files</a>. The commands and functions used are explained, and followed by examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are new to BBC BASIC (Z80), or you are experiencing difficulty with disk files you might find these notes useful. Some of the concepts and procedures described are quite complicated and require an understanding of file structures. If you have trouble understanding these parts, don&#8217;t worry. Try the examples and write some programs for yourself and then go back and read the notes again. As you become more comfortable with the fundamentals, the complicated bits become easier.</p>

<p>If you understand the way files work, skip the next two paragraphs. If you understand random and indexed files, skip the following two paragraphs as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_basics"><a class="anchor" href="#_basics"></a><span id="basics">Basics</span></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many people are confused by the jargon that is often used to describe the process of storing and retrieving information. This is unfortunate, because the individual elements are very simple and the most complicated procedures are only a collection of simple bits and pieces.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All computers are able to store and retrieve information from a non-volatile medium. (In other words, you don&#8217;t lose the information when the power gets turned off.) Audio cassettes are used for small micro computers, diskettes for medium sized systems and magnetic tape and large disks for big machines. In order to be able to find the information you want, the information has to be organised in some way. All the information on one general subject is gathered together into a FILE. Within the file, information on individual items is grouped together into RECORDS.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_serial_sequential_files"><a class="anchor" href="#_serial_sequential_files"></a><span id="serial">Serial (Sequential) Files</span></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Look upon the cassette or diskette as a drawer in a filing cabinet. The drawer is full of folders called FILES and each file holds a number of enclosures called RECORDS. Sometimes the files are in order in the drawer, sometimes not. If you want a particular file, you start at the beginning of the drawer and search your way through until you find the file you want. Then you search your way through the records in the file until you find the record you want.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is very similar to the way a cassette is searched for a particular file. You put the cassette in the recorder, type in the name of the file you want and push play. You then go and make a cup of tea whilst the computer reads through all the files until it comes to the one you want. Because the cassette is read serially from start to end, it&#8217;s very difficult to do it any other way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Life is easier with a computer that uses diskettes (or disks). There is an index which tells the computer where to look for each of the files and the serial search for the file is not necessary. However, once you have found the file, you still need to read through it to find the record you want.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a number of ways to overcome this problem. We will consider the two simplest; random access (or relative) files and indexed files.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_random_access_files"><a class="anchor" href="#_random_access_files"></a><span id="random">Random Access Files</span></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The easiest way to find the record you want is to identify each record with a number, like an account number. You can then ask for, say, the 23rd record. This is similar to turning to page 23 in the account book. This works very well at first. Every time you get a new customer you start a new page. Most of the pages have a lot of empty space, but you must have the same amount of space available for each account, otherwise your numbering system won&#8217;t work. So, even at the start, there are a lot of gaps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What happens when you close an account? You can&#8217;t tear out the page because that would upset the numbering system. All you can do is draw a line through it - in effect, turn it into a blank page. Before long, quite a number of pages will be 'blank' and a growing proportion of your book is wasted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With other forms of 'numbering', say by the letters of the alphabet, you could still not guarantee to fill all the pages. You would have to provide room for the Zs, but you may never get one. When you started entering data, most of the pages would be blank and the book would only gradually fill up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same happens with this sort of file on a diskette. A random file which has a lot of empty space in it is described as sparse. Most random files start this way and most never get more than about ¾ full. Count the number of empty 'slots' in your address book and see what proportion this is of the total available.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_indexed_files"><a class="anchor" href="#_indexed_files"></a><span id="indexed">Indexed Files</span></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose we want to hold our address book on the computer. We need a number of records each holding the name, address, telephone number, etc of one person. In our address book, we have one or two pages per letter of the alphabet and a number of 'slots' on each page. With this arrangement, the names are in alphabetical order of their first letter. This is very similar to the way the accounts book was organised except that we don&#8217;t know the page number for each name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we had an index at the front of the book we could scan the index for the name and then turn to the appropriate page. We would still be wasting a lot of space because some names, addresses etc are longer than others and our 'slots' must be large enough to hold the longest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose we numbered all the character positions in the book and we could easily move to any character position. We could write all the names, addresses, etc, one after the other and our index would tell us the character position for the start of each name and address. There would be no wasted space and we would still be able to turn directly to the required name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What would happen when we wanted to cancel an entry? We would just delete the name from the index. The entry would stay in its original place in the book, but we would never refer to it. Similarly, if someone changed their address, we would just write the name and the new address immediately after the last entry in the book and change the start position in the index. Every couple of years we would rewrite the address book, leaving out those items not referenced in the index and up-date the index (or write another one).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not a practical way to run a paper and pencil address book because it&#8217;s not possible to turn directly to the 3423rd character in a book, and the saving in space would not be worth the tedium involved. However, with BBC BASIC you can turn to a particular character in a file and the tedium only takes a couple of seconds, so it&#8217;s well worth doing.</p>

<h4 id="_introduction_2"><a class="anchor" href="#_introduction_2"></a><span id="bbcintro">Introduction</span></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conventional serial disk file procedures are little different from file procedures for cassette based computers. With serial files the records need only be as large as the data to be stored and there are no empty records. (The data item FRED only occupies 4 bytes whereas ERMINTRUDE occupies 10 bytes.) Consequently serial files are the most space efficient way to hold data on a disk (or any other storage media).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Serial files cannot be used to access particular records from within the file quickly and easily. In order to do this with the minimum access time, random access files are necessary. However, a random file generally occupies more space on the disk than a serial file holding the same amount of data because the records must be a fixed length and some of the records will be empty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most versions of BASIC only offer serial and random files, but because of the way that disk files are handled by BBC BASIC (both on the BBC computer and CP/M-80 computers using BBC BASIC (Z80)), it is possible to construct indexed, and even linked, files as well. Indexed files take a little longer to access than random files and it is necessary to have a separate index file, but they are generally the best space/speed compromise for files holding a large amount of data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_how_data_is_readwritten"><a class="anchor" href="#_how_data_is_readwritten"></a><span id="howdata">How Data is Read/Written</span></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As far as the programmer is concerned, data can be written to and read from a file a data item or a character (byte) at a time. In fact, there is a buffer between the program and the disk operating system (CP/M), but this need only concern you when you are organising your program for maximum disk efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of the character by character action of the write/read process, it is possible (in fact, necessary) to keep track of your position within the file. BBC BASIC does this for you automatically and provides a pointer <a href="#ptr">PTR</a> (a pseudo-variable) which holds the position of the NEXT character (byte) to be written/read. Every time a character is written/read PTR is incremented by 1, but it is possible to set PTR to any number you like. This ability to 'jump around' the file enables you to construct both random (relative) and indexed files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BBC BASIC provides the facility for completely free-format binary data files. Any file which can be read by the computer, from any source and in any data format, can be processed using the <a href="#bget">BGET</a>, <a href="#bput">BPUT</a> and <a href="#ptr">PTR</a> functions.</p>

<h5 id="_numeric_data"><a class="anchor" href="#_numeric_data"></a><span id="numeric">Numeric Data</span></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to make the most efficient use of disk space and to preserve accuracy, numerics are stored in a data file in binary format, not as strings of characters. To prevent confusion when numerics are being read from a file, both integers and reals occupy 5 bytes (40 bits). If they were stored as character strings they could occupy up to 10 bytes. For compatibility with other BASICs, you can store numerics as strings by using the <a href="bbckey4.html#str">STR$</a> function.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_how_strings_are_stored"><a class="anchor" href="#_how_strings_are_stored"></a><span id="strings">How Strings are Stored</span></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Strings are stored in a data file as the ASCII bytes of the string followed by a carriage-return. If you need a line feed as well, it&#8217;s no problem to add it using the Byte-Put function <a href="#bput">BPUT#</a>. Similarly, extraneous characters included in files produced by other programs can be read and, if necessary, discarded using <a href="#bget">BGET#</a>.</p>

<h4 id="_how_files_are_referred_to"><a class="anchor" href="#_how_files_are_referred_to"></a><span id="referred">How Files are Referred To</span></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We refer to a file by its name. Unfortunately, this is too complicated for the Disk Operating System (CP/M). Consequently, the only time CP/M refers to a file by its name is when it opens the file. From then on, it refers to the file by the number it allocated to it when it was opened. This number is called the 'file handle'.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_file_buffering"><a class="anchor" href="#_file_buffering"></a><span id="buffering">File Buffering</span></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Logically, BBC BASIC (Z80) transfers data to and from files one byte at a time. CP/M-80 does not handle single byte data transfer directly so BBC BASIC (Z80) buffers the data into blocks; this is transparent to the user.</p>

<p>MERGE.BBC is a BBC BASIC (Z80) program which combines two program files into a third program file. It asks you for the names of the two input files and the name of the output file. If the same line number exists in both files, the program line from the second file will be included in the output file immediately after the line from the first file (the number of both lines will be the same). This may confuse you, but it won&#8217;t confuse your computer; providing the program is still syntactically correct, it will run. If you want to clean up the mess, renumber the resulting program and delete the lines you don&#8217;t want.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You cannot use a file until you have told the system it exists. In order to do this you must OPEN the file for use. Other versions of BASIC allow you to choose the file number. In order to improve efficiency, BBC BASIC (Z80) chooses the number for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you open the file, a file handle (an integer number) is returned by the interpreter and you will need to store it for future use. (The open commands are, in fact, functions which open the appropriate file and return its file handle.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You use the file handle for all subsequent access to the file. (With the exception of the <a href="opsys0.html">STAR commands</a> outlined previously.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the system has been unable to open the file, the handle returned will be 0. This will occur if you try to open a non-existent file in the input mode (<a href="#openin">OPENIN</a> or <a href="#openup">OPENUP</a>).</p>

<p>On a networked system, OPENOUT opens the file in 'compatibility' mode and the file is not available to any other user.

<p>EOF# is only really of use when dealing with serial (sequential) files.

<p>EOF# is only true if PTR# is set beyond the last byte written to in the file. It will NOT be true if an attempt has been made to read from an empty area of a sparse random access file. Reading from an empty area of a sparse file will return garbage. Because of this, it is difficult to tell which records of an uninitialised random access file have had data written to them and which are empty.
