Publish to GitHub Pages

Antora is designed to create sites that run anywhere, whether it be on a static web host or the local filesystem. However, some hosts offer “features” that mess with Antora’s output. GitHub Pages is one of those hosts.
Jekyll and underscore files

By default, GitHub Pages runs all files through another static site generator named Jekyll (even if your repository is not set up to use Jekyll). Since Antora already produces a ready-made site, there’s absolutely no need for this step. But it’s more than just the wasted effort.

Jekyll has the nasty side effect of removing all files that begin with an underscore (_). Why is this a problem? By default, Antora puts UI files in a folder named _. It also places images inside the folder named _images. When Jekyll comes through, it wipes out these folders. As a result, you get no UI and no images.
.nojekyll

Fortunately, there’s a way to disable this “feature” of GitHub Pages. The solution is to add a .nojekyll file to the root of the published site (i.e., the output directory configured in your playbook).

The presence of the .nojekyll file at the root of the gh-pages branch tells GitHub Pages not to run the published files through Jekyll. The result is that your Antora-made site will work as expected.
